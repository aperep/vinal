## Source files

The folder `sage` contains the Sagemath version of the Vinberg's algorithm. It is stable and recommended to use.

The folder `sympy` contains its rewrite to the pure Python, which is based on `sympy`. It is a work-in-progress and probably not usable.

The folder 'CoxIter' is a git submodule for the project [CoxIter](https://rgugliel.github.io/CoxIter) by Rafael Guglielmetti. If you intend to use it, compile it into an executable `coxiter` and put into your working folder.
