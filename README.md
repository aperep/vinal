# Vinberg's algorithm

This project provides a realization of [Vinberg's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinberg%27s_algorithm) on [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/).

This is a work-in-progress that is missing a user interface and a procedure to check the completeness of the found set of roots.
