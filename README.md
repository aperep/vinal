This project provides a realization of [Vinberg's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinberg%27s_algorithm) on [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/).

This is a work-in-progress that is missing a user interface.

By [Nikolai Bogachev](https://github.com/nvbogachev) and [Alexander Perepechko](https://github.com/aperep).


It uses [CoxIter](https://github.com/rgugliel/CoxIter) for checking the completeness of the found set of roots, you need to compile it to ./CoxIter/coxiter ,
see [Documentation](https://rgugliel.github.io/CoxIter).
